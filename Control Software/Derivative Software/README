This folder contains the code that is used to signal the end of the service run. The algorithm looks at 
the derivative of the incoming water hardness sensor and compares it to an arbitrary threshold. 
If the derivative is greater than the threshold 3 or more times, the system will signal the 
service run to end. 

Circuit includes signal from the Jenway Meter -> AD620 -> Arduino

The AD620 is calibrated with a zero around -20mv coming in from the Jenway. 

Wiring Schematic to be added later.
